# Attention-based Sentiment Classification

This project explores the application of attention mechanisms in sentiment classification using a RNN model. Our experiments demonstrate that attention mechanisms enhance the model's ability to identify and focus on sentiment-relevant parts of sentences. Below are two visualization examples showing attention heatmaps for positive and negative sentiment analysis.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the SST-2 (Stanford Sentiment Treebank) dataset, which consists of movie reviews annotated with binary sentiment labels. The dataset is sourced from the [Stanford Sentiment Treebank](https://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html).
